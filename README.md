git-subrepo
===========

A very experimental alternative to git-subtree

Installation: drop the contents of this repository into your .git/hooks
directory.

Usage: In the root of your repository create a file .gitsubrepos containing
the names of subrepo directories, each on its own line. Commit a change in
one or more of the subrepo directories and see what happens...

See http://www.mos6581.org/git_subtree_alternative for details.
